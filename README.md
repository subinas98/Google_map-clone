# Google_map-clone
This is a map that is similar to google map or any other real-world map. I create this using mapbox and a youtube tutorial.
If you need to create a map clone like this you need to create a account in mapbox (link - https://www.mapbox.com/) then you will get a access token to create your own map.
Follow this tutorial from Web Dev Simplified for more information and step by step guidence. (link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OySigNMXOZU)
